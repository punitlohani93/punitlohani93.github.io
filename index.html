                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an international graduate student at New Jersey Institute of Technology pursuing a Masters degree in Computer Science. I am an aspiring full stack developer. I love animals, coding, sports, anime and boating. Just a simple Indian student aiming to carve out a successful career in the field of software and web development. I am still working on the contents of this site. This should be functional and better equipped as an interface in 3-4 weeks. Hang in there.... I will turn this into a beauty. Until then, you will have to do with a picture of my favorite Anime character. Not available on Twitter or Instagram until I get a job offer from them.
